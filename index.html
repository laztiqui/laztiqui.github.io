		<h3> Bio</h3>
		<p>Hello, my name is Lazaro Tiqui. I am a senior at NMSU studying electrical engineering with a focus in communication systems and digital signal processing. I received the SMART scholarship in my freshman year, leading to two summer internships and a full time job after graduation at The Research and Analysis Center in White Sands Missile Range. I plan to gain experience and build up my resume over the next few years. </p>
